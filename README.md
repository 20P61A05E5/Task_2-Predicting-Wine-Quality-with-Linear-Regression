# Task_2-Predicting-Wine-Quality-with-Linear-Regression
In this project, we have developed a machine learning model using linear regression to predict the quality of wine. Wine quality is a subjective measure that can be influenced by various chemical and sensory factors. By utilizing linear regression, we aim to uncover the relationships between these factors and wine quality, allowing us to make accurate predictions.

**Dataset:**
Our model is built on a dataset containing various attributes of wine, including chemical properties such as acidity, residual sugar, and alcohol content, as well as sensory properties like aroma and taste. The dataset also includes a quality score, which serves as the target variable for our regression analysis.

**Data Preprocessing:**
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers to ensure the quality of the dataset.
Feature Scaling: Normalizing or standardizing features to bring them to a common scale, which is essential for linear regression.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features that contribute to wine quality prediction.

**Model Building:**
We applied the linear regression algorithm to the preprocessed dataset. Linear regression is a supervised machine learning technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable (wine quality) and one or more independent variables (wine attributes) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

**Results:**
Our linear regression model provides insights into the factors that most strongly influence wine quality. It allows us to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical and sensory attributes with a certain level of confidence.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, our project demonstrates the effectiveness of linear regression in predicting wine quality based on a dataset containing various wine attributes. This model can be valuable for winemakers and enthusiasts in assessing and improving wine quality.
